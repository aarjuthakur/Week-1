# Week-1
This project specifically tackles fault detection in a New Energy Vehicle (NEV) system. By analyzing sensor data such as voltage, current, motor speed, temperature, vibration, ambient temperature, and humidity, a Random Forest Classifier is trained to identify different types of faults (Fault Label). The data is preprocessed by scaling the features to improve model performance. The project then visualizes the relationships between features using correlation heatmaps and pair plots and evaluates the model's effectiveness using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. The results indicate a high level of accuracy in classifying NEV faults based on the provided sensor data.
